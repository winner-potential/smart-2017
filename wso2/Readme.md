You have to download WSO2 4.2.0 from
http://wso2.com/products/complex-event-processor/
and the JDK 1.7 (7u80) from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html
to make this dockerfile work.

The unpacked files must be placed in the subfolders
wso2cep-4.2.0 and
